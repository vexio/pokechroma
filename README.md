# Pokémon Chroma

[![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis]

This is a disassembly of Pokémon Emerald ([pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald)), modified to create Pokémon Chroma Version, a fan game.

Join the official [Pokémon Chroma Discord](https://discord.gg/hdCaSQa) for updates on the development process.

If you're wanting to test out the game yourself, you can build this repo by downloading it and compiling or joining the official Discord for official releases/patches.

All assets under `custom assets` directory are custom assets from either myself (vexio/vxo), Spherical Ice, or the Acanthite Team.
